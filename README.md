# p5 Template

Use this template to get started on p5 projects. For the most part (or in the beginning), you'll only need to edit the sketch.js file.

Make sure you've downloaded Atom (text editor), Node.js, and http-server. For download installation instructions, check the [0. Getting Started](https://github.com/Isidore-Newman-School/Creative-Coding-S2017/blob/master/Classwork/0_gettingStarted.md) document.


## Running Programs

After everything is installed: 

#### Windows:

1. Open Node.js command prompt (Windows) or terminal (Mac/ Linux)
2. `cd` into the directory where your project is
3. type: 

        http-server

4. navigate to [http://localhost:8080](http://localhost:8080) in your web browser to see your project

## Not updating?

Things aren't updating when you change and save your code? Make sure your Chrome Dev Tools are open (right click on page). Click on Network tab and make sure "disable cache" is clicked. Chrome will only disable the cache when the dev panel is open.
